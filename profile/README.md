# Welcome to Promethon

Promethon is a new organization that aims to create innovative solutions using blockchain technology. We are a team of developers, researchers and enthusiasts who are passionate about building a decentralized and open web.

We are currently working on modifying the go-Ethereum codebase and building a new blockchain that will support various Dapp ideas. Some of the features that we are planning to implement are:

- Faster and cheaper transactions
- Enhanced privacy and security
- Scalable and interoperable smart contracts
- Customizable consensus mechanisms
- User-friendly interfaces and tools

We believe that blockchain technology has the potential to transform various industries and sectors, such as finance, healthcare, education, social media, gaming and more. We want to contribute to this vision by creating Dapps that will provide value and benefit to users and communities.

If you are interested in joining us or learning more about our projects, please visit our GitHub page or contact us at promethon@org.com. We welcome feedback, suggestions and collaboration from anyone who shares our enthusiasm for blockchain innovation.
